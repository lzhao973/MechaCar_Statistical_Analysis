1.We observed from Pr(>|t|), we can see vehicle_length and ground_clearance have very low probability that are lower than 0.05. That means they are non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.<br/>
2.No, the slope of the linear model is not to be zero due to vehicle_length and ground_clearance are dependent valuable that can be explained by the model.<br/>
3.The linear model predicts effectively but not perfect effectively because we have adjusted R-squared 0.6825

If we analyze from total_summary, it's not exceed 100, but lot3 has a variance greater than 100 because some extreme data inside lot3.
